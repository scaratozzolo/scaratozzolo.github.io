Scripts

* [Work-Clicker.js](https://github.com/scaratozzolo/scaratozzolo.github.io/tree/master/Bookmarklets#work-clickerjs)
* [Add-Table-Hover.js](https://github.com/scaratozzolo/scaratozzolo.github.io/tree/master/Bookmarklets#add-table-hoverjs)


## Work-Clicker.js

Are you at work or school? Can you not click cookies? This script will automatically click the big cookie once every 50 milliseconds. You can also press a variety of keys to buy products from the store and upgrades. The point of this is to be able to play without being overly suspicious with a ton of random clicking.

```javascript
javascript:(function(){s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='https://scaratozzolo.github.io/Bookmarklets/Work-Clicker.js?v='+parseInt(Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(s);})();
```

* z - First Available Upgrade
* 1 - Clicker
* 2 - Grandma
* 3 - Farm
* 4 - Mine
* 5 - Factory
* 6 - Bank
* 7 - Temple

*Note: All numbers are referring to the number keys at the top of the keyboard, not the numpad*

## Add-Table-Hover.js

At work we use a reporting program that uses bootstrap tables, but doesn't have hover. Now it does.

```javascript
javascript:(function(){s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='https://scaratozzolo.github.io/Bookmarklets/Add-Table-Hover.js?v='+parseInt(Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(s);})();
```
